My Approach :- 

Time Series -> 1987 Black Monday, 1997 Southeast Asian crisis, 2001 dotcom, 2007 Global Financial Crisis -> Compare with Covid and use correlation

Impact of Interest rates and Gold Prices are a good indicator

Then see the response of the Fed for each

Model in into a Regression problem

For capturing trends and predicting future quarters -> Use LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)

Basically starting from 1985, dividing the timeline into major points of crisis for capturing historic cycles of Interest Rates and Stock Market Values. 

Then comparing them with Covid to find any trends/ similarities. 

Final step would be to capture this information in LSTM for comparison with Post-Covid and future forecasting.

Impact of Post-COVID Interest Rate Changes and Monetary Policy Tightening on Global and Indian Financial Markets
Global Financial Markets
Rising Interest Rates:

Combatting Inflation: In response to the inflationary pressures that surged after the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks worldwide, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, began raising interest rates. This was aimed at curbing inflation, which had been driven by supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and high consumer demand.
Market Volatility: The shift to higher interest rates led to significant volatility in global financial markets. Stocks, particularly in growth sectors like technology, experienced sharp declines as investors reassessed valuations in a higher interest rate environment.
Capital Flows: Higher interest rates in developed markets attracted capital flows from emerging markets, leading to currency depreciation and financial instability in some emerging economies.
Monetary Policy Tightening:

Quantitative Tightening: Central banks also began unwinding the massive asset purchases they had made during the pandemic, further tightening monetary conditions. This reduced liquidity in global markets, contributing to higher borrowing costs and slower economic growth.
Global Debt Concerns: The tightening of monetary policy raised concerns about global debt sustainability, especially for countries and companies that had accumulated significant debt during the pandemic at low interest rates. Rising rates increased the cost of servicing this debt, leading to fears of defaults and financial instability.
Sociopolitical Factors:

Geopolitical Tensions: The post-COVID period has also been marked by rising geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These tensions have exacerbated market volatility and created additional uncertainties for global financial markets.
Social Unrest and Inequality: The pandemic highlighted and in some cases worsened social inequalities, leading to unrest in various countries. This sociopolitical instability can affect investor confidence and market performance, particularly in emerging markets.
Indian Financial Markets
Impact of Interest Rate Hikes:

RBI Rate Hikes: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) followed global central banks in raising interest rates to combat inflation. This had a cooling effect on the Indian stock markets, particularly on interest rate-sensitive sectors like real estate, banking, and consumer goods.
Bond Markets: Indian bond yields rose in response to the RBI's tightening, leading to a decline in bond prices. This impacted the returns of fixed-income investors and increased the cost of borrowing for businesses and the government.
Monetary Policy and Liquidity:

Liquidity Tightening: The RBI's actions to reduce excess liquidity in the system led to higher borrowing costs and reduced credit availability. This slowed down economic recovery, particularly in sectors reliant on credit growth.
Capital Outflows: Higher interest rates in the U.S. and other developed markets prompted capital outflows from Indian equities and bonds. This exerted pressure on the Indian rupee, leading to depreciation and making imports more expensive, further fueling inflation.
Sociopolitical Factors:

Domestic Political Stability: India's relatively stable political environment helped cushion the impact of global financial volatility. However, concerns about policy continuity and reform implementation can still influence investor sentiment.
Global Trade Dynamics: India's reliance on imports for energy and certain raw materials makes it vulnerable to global trade disruptions. Post-pandemic geopolitical tensions and trade policies have the potential to impact Indiaâ€™s trade balance and economic growth.
