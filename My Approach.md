My Approach :- 

Time Series -> 1987 Black Monday, 1997 Southeast Asian crisis, 2001 dotcom, 2007 Global Financial Crisis -> Compare with Covid and use correlation

Impact of Interest rates and Gold Prices are a good indicator

Then see the response of the Fed for each

Model in into a Regression problem

For capturing trends and predicting future quarters -> Use LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)

Basically starting from 1985, dividing the timeline into major points of crisis for capturing historic cycles of Interest Rates and Stock Market Values. 

Then comparing them with Covid to find any trends/ similarities. 

Final step would be to capture this information in LSTM for comparison with Post-Covid and future forecasting.
